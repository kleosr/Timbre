# Timbre

Timbre is a mobile application that allows users to speak instructions to create micro-services (micro-MCPs) on the fly. These micro-services are registered, discoverable, and capable of collaborating with other services.

## Implementation Details

### Voice Recognition

The app uses platform-specific speech recognition APIs:
- Android: Google Speech Recognition API
- iOS: Apple Speech Framework

### Service Definition

Micro-services are defined using a standardized JSON schema that specifies:
- Service capabilities and requirements
- Input/output parameters
- Collaboration patterns
- Runtime environment needs

### Service Registry

Services are registered both locally and in the cloud, enabling:
- Discovery across devices
- Versioning and updates
- Permission management
- Usage analytics

## Use Cases

### Location-Based Services

- Mark locations on maps
- Create geofence triggers
- Share location-based information

### Activity-Tracking Services

- Running companions with voice feedback
- Workout tracking with custom prompts
- Health data aggregation

### Productivity Services

- Voice-activated notes and reminders
- Calendar management
- Task automation
